## Purpose of the following commands

- 'mkdir': [used to create directories]
- 'cd': [change the current working directory to get info, modify, read, etc. inside of your system]
- 'code': [acts as a bridge between my terminal (gitbash) and visual studio code]
- 'ls': [quickly view all files within the selected directory]

## Why Version Control is Important

With version control, it is possible to
- See what you changed, when you changed it.
- Track who contributed to specific changes.
- Track the specific reasons a change was made.
- Have multiple developers work on different parts without impacting the other.
- Have backups of previous versions in the event they are needed.
